  <p>I'm a 4th year CS student at BYU, and will graduate in April 2019. Right now, my wife and I are taking a semester to volunteer by teaching English in Russia, which will finish in December. Yes, it's a crazy thing to do, and yes, it's an amazing experience.</p> 
  <p>This summer, I worked for Instructure as a software engineer intern. My team and I rolled out a microservice to our users, and started on another. I loved the exposure to new technology! I've also worked on BYU's custom LMS (Learning Management System), where I got my first taste of real web development - I pored over a massive code base, wrangled existing code, and built a website from scratch.</p>
  <p>I love it all, from tinkering over front-end design to considering a full stack to enjoying the freedom of the back end. Not having to worry about browser compatibility when working on the backend is great, but I also love implementing something that's visible, and more than just an API.</p>
  <p>When I'm not coding or in class or teaching English to crazy Russian kids, I'm usually reading whatever I can get my hands on. My wife and I love spending time kayaking and being outdoors in the mountains. I also play the organ, which is just as cool as it sounds.</p>
