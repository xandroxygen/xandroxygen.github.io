    synopsis: A hackweek Pomodoro timer.
    description: I enjoy using the Pomodoro technique to manage my time, but wasn't satisfied with the existing timers out there. So, I built my own. This was a hackweek project and took less than a week of work to get running, thanks to Nuxt and the beauty of static sites.

    synopsis: Instructure's secure and scalable file service.
    description: A fundamental change to the way Canvas and other Instructure handles files from users. I introduced a Kinesis -> Lambda batch processing stream, migrated a massive Dynamo database, and provisioned and deployed it to multiple AWS regions. This service consolidated several disparate and insecure code paths for file uploading into one, removing a huge chunk of dead code.

  - name: microparsec
    synopsis: Simple text parser for keywords and regex.
    description: A bare-bones text parser that looks for keywords and regular expressions and plucks them out of the text. Inspired by Todoist's Quick Add functionality, which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand what you type. This is a very simple version (<100loc!), but was an interesting exercise in using regular expressions.

    synopsis: Rewrite of deprecated Marathon Web UI.
    description: Lingotek depends on Mesos and Marathon for container management, but the Web UI had been marked as deprecated and was lacking needed features. I built this from the ground up as a wrapper around Marathon API calls. It replicates the existing Web UI and provides extended features that reduced a 5-step deployment process (editing JSON!) to 1 click.

    synopsis: Fuzzy searching of massive user databases.
    description: The microservice built with my team at Instructure, which I helped to polish for release. Used in Canvas to search for users to send messages to across all courses, and provided a 15x speed boost in searching. I added functionality to the API, upgraded the service to Webpack 2, and even broke prod once. <span>&#x1f643;</span>

  - name: GPA Calculator (Elm)
    synopsis: Easy cumulative GPA calculator built in Elm.
    description: The GPA calculator is my version of a "Hello World" for a language - easy logic, actually does something, and is just complex enough to get a sense for the language and tools. I've been curious about Elm for a while, so I did something about it and built this.

  - name: reload-server-webpack-plugin
    synopsis: Plugin that I forked to expand its abilities.
    description: This plugin helped my team at Instructure drop its dependency on <code>nodemon</code> for live reloading. However, it didn't have the capability to allow arguments on <code>node</code> or the server script. I added those capabilities and submitted a PR. One day, it'll get merged...

    description: Over the course of the semester, my team of 4 built both the client and server for this Java desktop app. We used Github to collaborate on this relatively large application, and used many design patterns as required by our professor. Our project had one of the lowest bug counts in the class.

    description: Final project for the Advanced Programming class, which was done on Android devices. This app was built from the ground up, other than the server. Though the specs didn't require much in the way of design, I went out of my way to make sure it followed Material Design principles, which made the TAs pleasantly surprised.
