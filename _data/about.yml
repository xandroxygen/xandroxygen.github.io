interesting:
  - item: I'm a 4th year CS student at BYU, and will graduate in April 2019. I just started a part-time job during school as a DevOps Intern at Lingotek, where I work on software that will empower our development teams and make managing the company's operations a little easier. My wife and I just returned from a semester abroad, which we spent as volunteers teaching English in Russia. Yes, it was a crazy thing to do, and yes, it was an amazing experience.
  - item: This summer, I worked for Instructure as a software engineer intern. My team and I rolled out a microservice to our users, and started on another. I loved the exposure to new technology! I've also worked on BYU's custom LMS (Learning Management System), where I got my first taste of real web development - I pored over a massive code base, wrangled existing code, and built a website from scratch.
  - item: I love it all, from tinkering over front-end design to considering a full stack to enjoying the freedom of the back end. Not having to worry about browser compatibility when working on the backend is great, but I also love implementing something that's visible, and more than just an API.
  - item: When I'm not coding or in class or teaching English to crazy Russian kids, I'm usually reading whatever I can get my hands on. My wife and I love spending time kayaking and being outdoors in the mountains. I also play the organ, which is just as cool as it sounds.
