interesting:
  - item: I'm a 4th year CS student at BYU, and will graduate in December 2019. During school, I'm a (part-time) software engineer at Instructure, working on services and underlying platforms that helps Canvas run a little bit easier and a little more secure.
  - item: Last year, I worked on the Ops team at Lingotek, where I built an internal tool to make container orchestration a little easier and to allow developers to deploy their own code. My wife and I also spent a semester abroad as volunteers teaching English in Russia. Yes, it was a crazy thing to do, and yes, it was an amazing experience.
  - item: For the past two summers, I worked for Instructure as a software engineer intern. My team and I rolled out two new services to our users built on AWS's Kinesis and S3. I loved the exposure to new technology! I've also worked on BYU's custom LMS (Learning Management System), where I got my first taste of real web development - I pored over a massive code base, wrangled existing code, and built a website from scratch.
  - item: I love it all, from tinkering over front-end design to considering a full stack to enjoying the freedom of the back end. Not having to worry about browser compatibility when working on the backend is great, but I also love implementing something that's visible, and more than just an API.
  - item: When I'm not coding or in class or teaching English to crazy Russian kids, I'm usually reading whatever I can get my hands on. My wife and I love spending time kayaking and being outdoors in the mountains. I also play the organ, which is just as fun as it sounds. I'm a 4-year member of the BYU Men's Chorus, the largest and greatest collegiate men's chorus there is.
